<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">(1) The Principal Investigator/Project 
Director/Program Director (PI/PD) is the individual designated by the grantee, 
and approved by the sponsoring agency, who will be responsible for the 
scientific or technical direction of the project.  If more than one, the 
first one listed will have primary responsiblity for the project and the 
submssion of reports.  All others listed are considered co-PI/PD, and share 
in the responsiblity of the scientific or technical direction of the 
project.  The term "Principal Investigator" generally is used in research 
projects, while the term "Project Director/Program Director" generally is used 
in education, and service projects.  For purposes of this glossary PI/co-PI 
is interchangeable with PD/co-PD. (2) The individual bearing primary 
responsibility for all essential aspects of the project or protocol, including 
programmatic work, compliance with government, sponsor and university policies 
and regulations, fiscal stewardship of sponsored funds, and all administrative 
requirements of the project.  The Principal Investigator (PI) is the 
primary individual involved in the design, conduct and reporting of the 
sponsored project. In most cases, the PI is also the Project Director 
(PD). In cases where the PI is not eligible to be the PD (such as pre-doc 
graduate fellowship grants), the institution may name a mentoring faculty member 
as the PD.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
