clear, and brief description of the project. It should outline the problem, the 
objectives, expected outcomes, including significance of the project to the 
field being studied. The abstract is usually written in less technical language 
than the proposal narrative. Alternate Compliance definition: A concise, clear, 
and brief non-scientific (readable to a high school senior) description of the 
project. It should include (1) why the study was proposed (background) (2) the 
reason for conducting the study (rationale and objectives), and (3)the expected 
outcomes (benefits) for conducting the study. See also: Proposal Abstract, and 
Technical Abstract.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
