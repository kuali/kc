<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all 
of the following criteria: (1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or 
frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the 
protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population 
being studied; (2) related or possibly related to participation in the research 
(in this guidance document, possibly related means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by 
the procedures involved in the research); and (3) suggests that the research 
places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized. See also Adverse Events, OHRP Guidance.<b></b></p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
