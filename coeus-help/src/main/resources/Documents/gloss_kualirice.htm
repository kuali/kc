<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">Community. Provides an enterprise-class middleware 
suite of integrated products that allow both Kuali and non-Kuali applications to 
be built in an agile fashion, such that developers are able to react to end-user 
business requirements in an efficient manner to produce high-quality business 
applications. Built with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts in mind, 
KR enables developers to build robust systems with common enterprise workflow 
functionality, customizable and configurable user interfaces with a clean and 
universal look and feel, and general notification features to allow for a 
consolidated list of work 'action items.' All of this adds up to providing a 
re-usable development framework that encourages a simplified approach to 
developing true business functionality as modular applications.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
