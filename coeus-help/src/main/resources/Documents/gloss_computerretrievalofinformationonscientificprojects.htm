<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific 
Projects is a searchable database of federally funded biomedical research 
projects conducted at universities, hospitals, and other research 
institutions.  The database, maintained by the Office of Extramural 
Research at the National Institutes of Health, includes projects funded by the 
NIH, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services, Health Resources and Services 
Administration, Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, and Office of Assistant 
Secretary of Health.  Users, including the public, can use the CRISP 
interface to search for scientific concepts, emerging trends and techniques, or 
identify specific projects and/or investigators. </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
