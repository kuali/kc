<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">The process that KEW engine uses to determine the 
Routing for a Route Node. FlexRM is a general Route Module that is rule-based. 
Dedicated Route Modules conduct specialized Routing based on routing tables. The 
KEW engine provides some Route Modules for Routing through established 
organizational hierarchies. Clients may optionally provide their own Route 
Modules.  A Route Module is a routing component that the engine uses to 
generate action requests at a particular Route Node. FlexRM is a general Route 
Module that is rule-based. Clients can define their own Route Modules which can 
conduct specialized Routing based on routing tables (or any other desired 
implementation).</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
