<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="DISPLAY: none"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="DISPLAY: none"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There are many components that work together to make the KC 
system work, and they are too numerous and often too technical in nature to 
mention here.  However, this topic aims to briefly summarize the major ones 
to give you a basic level of understanding that will allow you to use the KC 
software to accomplish tasks with confidence and success.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Currently falling under the Kuali umbrella is a core system 
known as Kuali Rice (KR), which is comprised of several technical modules, 
including Kuali Nervous System (KNS), which encompasses infrastructure 
components, and  Kuali Enterprise Workflow (KEW), which automates routing 
of e-docs (electronic documents) for approval according to specified business 
rules.  These are considered "core" modules because they depend on one 
another, and non-core modules and their components depend on the core, since 
they are necessary for other functional modules to operate. The specifications 
are available for institutions to develop their own interfaces to the core 
system modules, since any dependency of one non-core component on another 
non-core component is flexible to allow implementation of unique combinations of 
subsets via parameterization and service interface definition to meet an 
institution’s unique needs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="DISPLAY: none"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Kuali Rice (KR) is an enterprise-class middleware suite of 
integrated products that make up a business application development framework 
for Kuali and non-Kuali applications using a modular, Service Oriented 
Architecture (SOA) approach with components such as workflow, notification, and 
user interface configuration.</p>
<p class="Heading4noautolinks"><a name="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_37_9" id="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_37_9"></a><a name="_D2HTopic_37" id="_D2HTopic_37">KNS</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="DISPLAY: none"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Kuali Nervous System (KNS) is the underlying infrastructure 
code that any KC module may employ to perform its functions. KNS is 
functionality common to many modules. Examples include creating custom 
attributes, attaching electronic images, uploading data from desktop 
applications, lookup/search routines, and database interaction. KNS is a core 
technical module composed of reusable code components that provide common pieces 
of functionality. The KNS is a technical framework that enforces consistency in 
the applications that use it. It promotes adherence to the architectural 
principles and development standards defined by the Kuali architects. KNS also 
provides a stable core of development tools providing a more efficient 
development paradigm.</p>
<p class="Heading4noautolinks"><a name="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_38_9" id="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_38_9"></a><a name="_D2HTopic_38" id="_D2HTopic_38">KSB</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="DISPLAY: none"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Kuali Service Bus (KSB) is a simple service bus geared 
towards easy service integration in an SOA architecture. In a world of 
difficult-to-use service bus products, KSB focuses on ease of use and 
integration.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">KSB features Message-Driven Service Execution, 
Transactional Asynchronous Messaging, Synchronous Messaging, Queue Style 
Messaging, Topic Style Messaging, Quality of Service, Service Discovery, 
Reliability, Persisted Callback,       Primitive 
Business Activity Monitoring, Spring Based Integration, and  Programmatic 
Based Integration.</p>
<p class="Heading4noautolinks"><a name="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_39_9" id="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_39_9"></a><a name="_D2HTopic_39" id="_D2HTopic_39">KEW</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="DISPLAY: none"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Kuali Enterprise Workflow (KEW) is the Kuali infrastructure 
service that electronically routes an e-doc to its approvers in a prescribed 
sequence, according to established business rules based on the e-doc content. It 
is considered a general-purpose electronic routing infrastructure or “workflow 
engine.” Client applications use KEW to automate and regulate the routing and 
approval processes for the transactions/documents they create. It starts with an 
e-doc that users compose in a client application such as the KC or some other 
Web application that requires routing and approval of documents.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">KEW then routes the e-doc electronically to the attention 
of designated individuals, based on institutional or departmental business rules 
and policies. Via this centralized routing system, users can access and search 
for many types of e-docs from various client applications.  This is 
accomplished from a single location, the Action List and Doc Search. The Route 
Log for a given document allows users to follow its progress. KEW streamlines 
mediated business processes across the enterprise.</p>
<p class="Heading4noautolinks"><a name="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_40_9" id="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_40_9"></a><a name="_D2HTopic_40" id="_D2HTopic_40">KIM</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="DISPLAY: none"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Kuali Identity Management (KIM) provides central identity 
and access management services. It also provides management features for 
Identity, Groups, Roles, Permissions, and their relationships with each 
other.  All integration with KIM is through a simple and consistent service 
API (Java or Web Services). The services are implemented as a general-purpose 
solution that could be leveraged by both Kuali and non-Kuali applications 
alike.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">KIM services are architected in such a way as to allow for 
the reference implementations to be swapped out for custom implementations that 
integrate with other 3rd party Identity and Access Management solutions. The 
various services can be swapped out independently of each other. For example, 
many institutions may have a directory solution for identity, but may not have a 
central group or permission system. In cases like this, the Identity Service 
implementation can be replaced while the reference implementations for the other 
services can remain intact.</p>
<p class="Heading4noautolinks"><a name="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_41_9" id="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_41_9"></a><a name="_D2HTopic_41" id="_D2HTopic_41">KEN</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="DISPLAY: none"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Kuali Enterprise Notification (KEN) acts as a broker for 
all university business-related communications by allowing end-users and other 
systems to push informative messages to the campus community in a secure and 
consistent manner. All notifications are processed asynchronously and are 
delivered to a single list where other messages such as workflow related items 
(KEW action items) also reside. In addition, end-users can configure their 
profile to have certain types of messages delivered to other end points such as 
email, mobile phones, etc.</p>
<p class="Heading4noautolinks"><a name="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_42_9" id="_d2h_bmk__D2HTopic_42_9"></a><a name="_D2HTopic_42" id="_D2HTopic_42">E-Doc</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="DISPLAY: none"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">E-doc is short for electronic document.  The two terms 
are used interchangeably to refer to KC’s online forms that allow for the entry 
and selection of information.  That information can then be saved for 
future modification by one or more designated users, each of whom may have 
different assigned roles in e-doc completion.  E-docs can be routed to 
collaborators, reviewers and approvers electronically.  Routing status is 
tracked.  Records of performed actions are preserved for reference.  
In KC, a user initiates a “transaction” from their desktop Web browser by 
creating a new e-doc. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Upon saving or navigating between the various pages that 
make up the new e-doc (each with a separate screen), the initiator or 
collaborator receives immediate feedback on the validity of the document both in 
light of the appropriateness of data and the compliance with business rules via 
red error messages right on the document screen.  Valid documents are 
routed by KEW to one or more designated Reviewers and Approvers based on the 
type of transaction and content of the e-doc. Fully approved transactional 
e-docs are sent for final disposition actions.  One of those actions is to 
format and submit the approved document electronically to external 
organizations, such as Grants.gov.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Anyone who initiates, reviews or approves research 
administration transactions may be a user of an e-doc, including: Principal 
Investigators; Co-Investigators; Departmental Administrators; Departmental 
support staff, professional staff, and faculty; Fiscal Officers and Delegates; 
Deans, Directors, and Department Chairs; Institutional Review Board members; 
Office of Sponsored Projects Reviewers; Preparers; Aggregators; Budget Creators; 
Narrative Writers; FYI Viewers, etc.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></div></div></body></html>
