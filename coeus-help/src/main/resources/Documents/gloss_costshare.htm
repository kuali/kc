<h5 class="GlossaryHeading"><a name="_D2HTopic_1028" id="_D2HTopic_1028">Cost Share</a></h5>
<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">(1) The portion of total project costs that are paid 
from sources other than the sponsor. Â (2) The portion of project or program 
cost not borne by the sponsor and is the University's share of the cost of 
research. In Kuali Cost Share Transfers and Cost Share Encumbrances are 
generated by the accounting cycle to record this commitment. (3) The portion of 
the total cost of a project that is not paid by the sponsoring agency, but 
rather is paid by the recipient organization or by a third party. Cost share is 
identified on the Research Budget and Routing Form during proposal submission, 
and is recorded during the project period in a cost-share sub-account of the 
primary project account.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
