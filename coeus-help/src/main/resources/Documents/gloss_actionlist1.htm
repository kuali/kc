<h5 class="GlossaryHeading">Action List</h5>
<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">A list that displays e-docs routed to you for some 
action (approval, acknowledgment, FYI). E-docs appear in your action list only 
when your action is requested, and disappear after you have taken action on 
them. Action list display preferences and filters can be set by the user.  
The action list is where a user's notification and workflow items are listed. 
This may also be referred to as a user's notification list. Clicking on an item 
in the action list will bring up details about a notification, if the item is a 
notification, or will bring up a document if the item is a workflow item. When 
logging into the system, a user is taken directly to their action list and can 
also return to their action list any time they click the "My Notifications" link 
in the menu section of the application.  Action List is a directory that 
displays all documents currently routed to Reviewers for Users may set display 
preferences and filter the list by document properties. From the Action List, 
the user can also access their Secondary Delegate Action List, which displays 
all documents currently routed to the Reviewers under Secondary 
Delegation.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
