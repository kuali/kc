<h5 class="GlossaryHeading"><a name="_D2HTopic_1524" id="_D2HTopic_1524">Vulnerable 
Participants</a></h5>
<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">Participants whose willingness to volunteer in a 
research protocol may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified 
or not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response 
from senior members of a hierarchy in case of a refusal to participate.  
Participants may be vulnerable based upon the class of individuals in which they 
may permanently or temporarily be associated.  Additional safeguard are (1) 
always given to selected classes (prisoners, individuals kept in detention 
facilities, children, and neonates), (2) sometimes given to selected classes 
when they are the focus of the research (pregnant women and human fetuses) by 
federal regulations.  The IRB may also require additional safeguards to 
others groups based upon the details of the proposed research protocol.  
These may include patients with incurable diseases, individuals with diminished 
capacity or incapable of giving consent, persons in nursing homes, unemployed or 
impoverished individuals, patients in emergency situations, ethnic minority 
groups, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, military, "normal volunteers" 
etc.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
