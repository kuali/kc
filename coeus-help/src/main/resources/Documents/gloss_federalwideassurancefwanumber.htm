<h5 class="GlossaryHeading"><a name="_D2HTopic_1138" id="_D2HTopic_1138">Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) 
Number</a></h5>
<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">The unique number that is assigned to the Federal 
wide Assurance. The Federal wide Assurance (FWA) is an assurance of compliance 
with the federal regulations for the protection of human subjects in research. 
It is approved by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) for all human 
subjects' research conducted or supported by the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS). The FWA is also approved by OHRP for Federal wide use, which 
means that other departments and agencies that have adopted the Federal Policy 
for the Protection of Human Subjects (also known as the Common Rule) may rely 
upon the FWA for the research that they conduct or support. <a href="http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile/FWA_start.asp">http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile/FWA_start.asp</a>
