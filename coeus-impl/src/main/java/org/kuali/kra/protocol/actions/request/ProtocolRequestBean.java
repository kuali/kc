/**
 * The ProtocolRequestBean is used for some of the common, yet simple,
 * protocol request actions.  Those actions are:
 * 
 * 1. Request to Close
 * 2. Request for Suspension
 * 3. Request to Close Enrollment
 * 4. Request to Re-open Enrollment
 * 5. Request for Data Analysis Only
 * 
 * For each of these request actions, a user can select a committee and give
 * a reason for the request.  Each request, though, will require a different
 * protocol action type and submission type entry in the database.  Please
 * see the ActionHelperBase class for how this class is used.
