     * This is a hack to make the silly Rule API behave properly. Because CentralAdmin contacts and unit Contacts are stored 
     * in the same collection, the Rule API will use the UnitContact BO type to build the error path when an error occurs.
     * This causes the CentralAdmin errors to show up in the UnitContact tab panel.
     * 
     * The only user error that can occur not selecting a project role. By removing the blank from the selection list
     * we can force a contact role to be applied to the CentralAdmin, thus preventing the user error. 
     * 
     * The Rule API is so moronic, there are untold numbers of hacks in the system to satisfy this API. Yes, this is just another one.
