/**
 * Class used for versioning protocol attachments.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The basic algorithm for versioning is the following:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li> check if versioning is required </li>
 * <li> version the File BO </li>
 * <li> associate the new File version with an "existing" Attachment BO </li>
 * <li> create a new Protocol Document </li>
 * <li> version the Protocol and all its BOs which includes all attachment BOs (that are referencing the new file BO) </li>
 * <li> set the new Protocol Document w/ the new Protocol version </li>
 * <li> set the struts form to reference the new Protocol Document </li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * 
 * It was easier to create the version of the file before the version of the Protocol to allow for easy updating of file references.
 * Also, versioning of the Protocol naturally only needs to happen once, at the end of this process.
