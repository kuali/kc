/**
 * This class is variation of DefaultSchduleSequence, it adds logic wrapper to dates returned by Quartz util.
 * <p>
 * Logic wrapper filters dates, to generate schedule for every month, every other month, etc ...
 * <p>
 * This implementation is very specifically addressed to deal with monthly, quarterly, annually, etc date filtering requirements. Implementation
 * uses org.quartz.TriggerUtils class to generate List of dates from Cron expression.
 * <p>
 * It uses current time zone, where application is hosted.
 * <p>
 * Note: Dates used in generating schedule must be wrapped with required time accuracy.
 * e.g.  Start Date: 02/01/09 10:10 End Date: 02/05/09 10:10 
 * Generated Dates will be in between 02/01/09 10:10 and 02/05/09 10:10.
 * Any date expected before 02/01/09 10:09 will be ignored. Date 02/01/09 10:00 will be ignored.
 * Any date expected after  02/05/09 10:11 will be ignored. Date 02/05/09 12:00 will be ignored.
