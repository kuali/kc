/**
 * Each RoleState corresponds to one specific user and one specific role.  
 * It stores the current state of the database, i.e. if "saved" is true, then
 * the user is assigned to this role in the database.  It also stores what
 * the end-user wants the role assignment to be in the "assigned" property.
 * If "assigned" is set to true, the end-user wants this user-role assignment
 * to exists in the database; otherwise it should not be in the database.
 * 
 * When the Permissions web page is viewed for the first time, the "saved"
 * and "assigned" flags will have the same value.  The end-user can then
 * edit the roles for the users which will result in the "assigned" flags
 * changing in value.  
 * 
 * When the document is saved, the "saved" and "assigned" flags are checked
 * to see what roles need to be added and/or removed.
