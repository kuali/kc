/**
 * This interface defines generic versioning behavior. Versioning always implies that 
 * a new SequenceOwner object is created from the original and its identifier is set 
 * to null.
 *  
 * All 1:1 and 1:M associations are copied and the new copies are assigned with the 
 * new SequenceOwner and their persistence identity is reset. Many:Many associations are 
 * handled differently.
 * 
 * They are also copied as part of the deep copy process. Making them transient would 
 * avoid serialization in the deep copy, but could also prevent persistence using JPA 
 * or OJB. So we eat the memory consumption during the deep copy where both the new 
 * and old sequence owner simultaneously have the same collections of M:N associates. 
 * As soon as the old sequence owner reference is not needed (i.e. just after versioning), 
 * it should set to null to allow garbage collection of its associated references.
 * 
 * In a simple versioning not involving the update of a M:N associate, the M:N 
 * associates' persistence identifities are NOT cleared. When the new SequenceOwner is saved
 * it's expected a new join table record will be added linking the new SequenceOwner
 * to the existing M:N associate.
 * 
 * In a versioning involving the update of one or more M:N associates, the M:N 
 * associates' persistence identifities are cleared, thus making them new versions.  The
 * newly versioned attachment must be manually associated with the new owner.
 * When the new SequenceOwner is saved, the new M:N associate will also 
 * be saved, and it's expected a new join table record will be automatically added linking the 
 * new SequenceOwner to the new M:N associate.
