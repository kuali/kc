     * Here's the story of this method:
     *
     * Rice found a great utility called DisplayTag (http://displaytag.sourceforge.net). I've worked with DisplayTag. It's a simple and effective tool for
     * creating tables with a lot of inherent functionality.
     *
     * Rice then ruined its simplicity by creating couplings to Rice classes in the exporters (CSV, XML, and XLS) so that the
     * basic DisplayTag behavior of exporting a table of POJOs no longer works. (These dependencies are manifested in properties set in displaytag.properties,
     * specifically, the export.<media>.class properties.
     *
     * Instead of working with a collection of POJOs Rice forced the collection to be a collection of ResultRows which have a bunch of Rice framework specific
     * properties. Each ResultRow forces the properties of the bean to be expressed as another Rice-specific type called a Column. A Column also has a bunch of
     * Rice-framework specific properties.
     *
     * This is the modus operandi of Rice. Find something which has great utility and modify it until it only works to solve one kind of Rice-specific
     * problem. In this case, they were trying to create a generic lookup solution. Along the way, they ruined a perfectly good utility API, DisplayTag.
     *
     * To work around this foolishness, this POJO has a factory method to create a ResultRow from itself. That ResultRow creates Column objects for each
     * property.
     */
    public ResultRow createResultRow() {
        ResultRow resultRow = new ResultRow(createColumns(), null, null);
        resultRow.setBusinessObject(this);

    }
