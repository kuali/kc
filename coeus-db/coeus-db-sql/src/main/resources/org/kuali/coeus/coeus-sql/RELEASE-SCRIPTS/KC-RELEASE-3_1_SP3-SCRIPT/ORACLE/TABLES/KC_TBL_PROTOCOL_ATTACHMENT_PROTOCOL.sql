-- The purpose of this script is to make the description field "required" for protocol and personnel attachments.
-- Along that line the description field in both tables is being set to not null.  In order to ensure older data
-- migrates appropriately, we need to run updates first to ensure that any attachments with null descriptions are given
-- a default value.
