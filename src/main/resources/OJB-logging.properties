# The LoggerClass entry tells OJB which concrete Logger implementation is to be used.
# If it is not specified (or this file is not present/found, then OJB will check
# whether there is a log4j.properties or commons-logging.properties file, in which
# case it will use Log4J/commons-logging. If neither is present, then OJB will default
# to commons-logging.

# Commons-logging
#LoggerClass=org.apache.ojb.broker.util.logging.CommonsLoggerImpl
# log4j based logging
#LoggerClass=org.apache.ojb.broker.util.logging.Log4jLoggerImpl
# OJB's own simple looging support

#
# The LogLevel entries tells OJB which LogLevels are active
# for the different loggers used within OJB
# Loglevels: DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL
# That is loglevel WARN won't log DEBUG and INFO messages,
# but will log WARN, ERROR, and FATAL messages
#
# Global default log level used for all logging
# entities if not specified
ROOT.LogLevel=WARN

# The Default Logger instance used within OJB
