    DTD for the Kuali data dictionary configuration file, version 1.0

    To support validation of your configuration file, include the following
    DOCTYPE element at the beginning (after the "xml" declaration):

    <!DOCTYPE dictionaryEntry PUBLIC
        "-//Kuali Project//DTD Data Dictionary 1.0//EN"
        "http://kuali.org/dtds/dataDictionary-1_0.dtd">
-->

<!-- ............  documentation conventions note  ............

    The comments associated with the xml elements serve two purposes and are
    prefixed with "DD:" or "JSTL:".

    DD: These comments refer to the way the xml data is stored in the
        DataDictionary.java instance.  Reference is made to the specific
        Java class used to store the data of each element.

    JSTL: These comments refer to the way the data is accessed from within JSP.
    In that case, JSP references a global constant called DataDictionary which
    is actually an instance of DataDictionaryMap.java.

    When an item is referenced using DataDictionaryMap, the data is always returned
    in the form of an ExportMap.java instance.  In this case, the element comments
    will refer to the java class that creates the ExportMap from the DataDictionary
    object.

<!-- ............  dictionaryEntry element  ............

    DD: The highest level objects in the data dictionary are of
        the following types:
        * BusinessObjectEntry
        * MaintenanceDocumentEntry
        * TransactionalDocumentEntry

    JSTL: The data dictionary is exposed as a Map which is accessed
    by referring to the "DataDictionary" global constant.  This Map contains
    the following kinds of entries keyed as indicated:
        * Business Object Entries -
            Key = businessObjectClass name
            Value = Map created by BusinessObjectEntryMapper
        * Maintenance Document entries -
            Key = DocumentType name
            Value = Map created by MaintenanceObjectEntryMapper
        * Transactional Document entries -
            Key = DocumentType name
            Value = Map created by TransactionalDocumentEntryMapper

    All elements are exposed to JSTL as Maps (where the element has a
    unique key by which they can be retrieved), or Strings.  For collections
    of elements having no unique key, the entry's position in the list
    (0, 1, etc.) is used as its index.

    All Maps (except the top-level DataDictionary one) are guaranteed to
    present their entries with an iteration order identical to the order
    in which the elements were defined in XML.

                            When doing a MV lookup on a collection, the returned BOs
                            are not necessarily of the same type as the elements of the
                            collection. Therefore, a means of mapping between the fields
                            for the 2 BOs are necessary. The template attribute of
                            <maintainableField> contained within <maintainableCollection>
                            tells us this mapping.

                            <maintainableField name="collectionAttrib" template="lookupBOAttrib">
                            means that when a list of BOs are returned, the lookupBOAttrib value
                            of the looked up BO will be placed into the collectionAttrib

                        The document authorizer classes have a method getEditMode, which is a map of edit mode to
                        value mappings.  Depending on the context, the value of the mapping may be relevant, and the logic determining
                        whether the value is relevant is often implemented in the JSP/tag layer.

                        Fields on a document (particularily maintenance documents) may be associated with
                        an edit mode.  If the edit mode is mapped to a relevant value, then the all fields associated with the edit mode
                        will be rendered unhidden.

                        The displayEditMode element is used to specify the edit mode that will be associated with the field.
                        If the document authorizer returns a map with this edit mode mapped to a proper value, then the field will be unhidden to the user.

                        Single value lookups expect field conversions to be passed in as a HTTP parameter when the lookups is invoked from a quickfinder icon (i.e. magnifying glass on page).
                        Field conversions are normally used to determine which fields will be returned when the "return value" link is clicked.

                        For example, if we're performing a quickfinder lookup and the field conversion string "a:document.someObject.a1,b:document.someObject.b1" is passed into the lookup,
                        this means that when we click on a lookup result row to be returned:

                    	* the value of property "a" from the selected result bo will be passed as the value of the HTTP parameter named "document.someObject.a1",
                    	  which, in turn, populates the POJO property of the same name on the form
                    	* the value of property "b" from the selected result bo will be passed as the value of the HTTP parameter named "document.someObject.b1",
                    	  which, in turn, populates the POJO property of the same name on the form

                        Normally, the field conversion string is automatically computed by the framework to return all of the primary key values of the looked up BO into the corresponding
                        foreign key values of the destination BO (i.e. document.someObject in the example above).  However, putting in this element will allow for the overriding of the
                        field conversions string.

                        Example from ContractManagerMaintenanceDocument.xml
                        <overrideFieldConversions>
                        personUserIdentifier:contractManagerUserIdentifier,
