<P class=GlossaryHeading>Vulnerable Participants</P>
<P class=C1HPopupTopicText>Participants whose willingness to volunteer in a 
research <A id=popup_32345 onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" 
href="gloss_protocol.htm">protocol</A> may be unduly influenced by the 
expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with 
participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy 
in case of a refusal to participate. Participants may be vulnerable based upon 
the class of individuals in which they may permanently or temporarily be 
associated. Additional safeguard are (1) always given to selected classes 
(prisoners, individuals kept in detention facilities, children, and neonates), 
(2) sometimes given to selected classes when they are the focus of the research 
(pregnant women and human fetuses) by federal regulations. The <A id=popup_32346 
onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" href="gloss_irb.htm">IRB</A> may 
also require additional safeguards to others groups based upon the details of 
the proposed research protocol. These may include patients with incurable 
diseases, individuals with deminished capacity or incapable of giving consent, 
persons in nursing homes, unemployed or impoverished individuals, patients in 
emergency situations, ethnic minority groups, homeless persons, nomads, 
refugees, military, "normal volunteers" etc.&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
