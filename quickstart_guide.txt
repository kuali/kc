This guide contains the basic instructions for:

- installing the out-of-the-box Kuali Coeus distribution
- building the Kuali Coeus source
- running the Kuali Coeus tests


*** Installing the out-of-the-box Kuali Coeus distribution ***

Requirements:

	- Java 1.5
	- Servlet 2.4 / JSP 2.0 Compatible Servlet Container such as Apache Tomcat 5.5
	- Oracle database instance

1. Run the database scripts using the instructions provided in db_scripts/ReadMe.txt

2. Place binary/kra-config.xml in one of the configured default locations: {Userhome}/kuali/main/ptd OR /opt/sa_forms/java/ptd/kra/kra-config.xml.
   (NOTE: This is what is often referred to as the external kra-config.xml, whereas the internal kra-config.xml is located within the webapp)
	* On Windows with Tomcat running as a service, the best location is usually c:\kuali\main\ptd
	* To use a different directory, open kra-ptd.war and edit the "config.location" parameter in /WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/kra-config.xml.

3. Edit parameters in the external kra-config.xml (that you just placed in step #2) as desired.
	* You will at least need to fill in the following parameters with your database connection information: datasource.url, datasource.username, datasource.password.
	* You will also need to change app.host to your server's host name (i.e. http://kuali.yourinstitution.edu:8080).
	* Other commonly changed parameters are: app.code, app.context.name

4. Obtain ojdbc14.jar from an oracle client install ({OracleHome}/jdbc/lib) or the Oracle site (http://www.oracle.com) and copy it into the common jar file library.
	* Example: For Tomcat 5.5, copy ojdbc14.jar into {tomcat install dir}/common/lib.

5. Deploy binary/kra-ptd.war to your servlet container (see user guide for your particular servlet container).

6. The KRA application should now be accessible at: {app.host}/{app.context.name} (as specified in the internal kra-config.xml -- app.context.name is kra-ptd, if not overridden).

7. Login as 'quickstart' (click on a tab or option and the login screen will appear).


*** Building the Kuali Coeus source ***

Requirements:

	- Java 1.5
	- Maven 2

1. From the command line, navigate to /kra_project and run this command: 'mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dwar=true package'. The .war will be in the /kra_project/target folder.


*** Running the Kuali Coeus tests ***

Requirements:

	- Java 1.5
	- Maven 2
	- Oracle database instance

1. The tests clear and repopulate several tables, so we recommend creating a unique database schema for running the tests, either by re-running kra_release_1.sql or copying an existing schema.

2. Place binary/kra-test-config.xml in {Userhome}/kuali/test/dev

3. Repeat step #3 under 'Installing the out-of-the-box KRA distribution' for kra-test-config.xml.

4. From the command line, navigate to /kra_project and run this command: 'mvn test'.
