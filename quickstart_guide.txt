*** Installing the out-of-the-box Kuali Coeus 2.0 Beta distribution ***

Requirements:

	- Java 1.5
	- Servlet 2.4 / JSP 2.0 Compatible Servlet Container such as Apache Tomcat 5.5
	- Oracle database instance

1. Run the database scripts using the instructions provided in sql/db_readme.txt

2. Place config/kc-config.xml.template in one of the configured default locations: {Userhome}/kuali/main/pre/kc-config.xml OR /opt/sa_forms/java/pre/kra/kc-config.xml.
   (NOTE: This is what is often referred to as the external kc-config.xml, whereas the internal kc-config.xml is located within the webapp)
   (ADDITIONAL NOTE: If you are upgrading and have an existing kc-config.xml in this location, please replace it, as new parameters are often added)
	* On Windows with Tomcat running as a service, the best location is usually c:\kuali\main\pre
	* To use a different directory, open kc-pre.war and edit the "alt.config.location" parameter in /WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/kc-config.xml.
	* You SHOULD also be able to pass a java parameter of alt.config.location to your j2ee container (not guaranteed to work)
	(NOTE: This file is the internal kc-config.xml and also contains the "environment" parameter referenced in the external kc-config.xml file)

3. Edit parameters in the external kc-config.xml (that you just placed in step #2) as desired.
	* You will at least need to fill in the following parameters with your database connection information: datasource.url, datasource.username, datasource.password.
	* You will also need to change app.host to your server's host name (i.e. http://kuali.yourinstitution.edu:8080).
	* Other commonly changed parameters are: app.code, app.context.name (be sure app.context.name matches your deployed webapp -- normally the name of your war file)
	* If you are using MySQL, see the MySQL changes at the end of this guide.

4. For Oracle: Obtain ojdbc14.jar from an oracle client install ({OracleHome}/jdbc/lib) or the Oracle site (http://www.oracle.com).
   For MySQL: Obtain the jar file for the appropriate MySQL jdbc driver from mysql.com.
   Copy the jdbc jar file into the common jar file library.
	* Example: For Tomcat 5.5, copy ojdbc14.jar into {tomcat install dir}/common/lib.

5. Deploy kc-pre.war to your servlet container (see user guide for your particular servlet container).

6. The KC application should now be accessible at: {app.host}/{app.context.name} (as specified in the external kc-config.xml -- app.context.name is kc-pre, if not overridden).

7. Login as 'quickstart' (click on a tab or option and the login screen will appear).

*** MySQL changes to external kc-config.xml file -- adjust datasource.url as needed to fit your install:

        <param name="datasource.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kcdev</param>
        <param name="datasource.ojb.platform">MySQL</param>
        <param name="datasource.platform">org.kuali.rice.core.database.platform.MySQLDatabasePlatform</param>
        <param name="datasource.driver.name">com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</param>
        <param name="datasource.pool.validationQuery">select 1</param>
