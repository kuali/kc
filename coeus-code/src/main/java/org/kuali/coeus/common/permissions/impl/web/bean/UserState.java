/**
 * A UserState maintains the current roles for a person as well as the
 * new roles.  First, it must be understood how the Permissions tab web page
 * works.  The end-user can add/delete users to/from documents as well as
 * change the roles that a user has.  Those changes, though, do not take
 * effect until a save is executed.  Therefore, we must maintain the current
 * state as saved in the database AND the new state as defined by the changes
 * made by the end-user.  When a save is executed, the current and new states 
 * are compared to determine the changes that are required to the database.
 * 
 * To accomplish the above, each UserState maintains a person and all of the
 * possible roles for that person.  Each possible role is kept in the RoleState 
 * which stores the current ("saved") and new states ("assigned") for that role.  
 * By storing all of the possible roles that can be assigned to the user, the 
 * process of updating the database becomes a simple task.  For example, if the 
 * new state is set to true and the current state is false, we know that the 
 * user must be assigned to that role.  Likewise, if the reverse is true, we know 
 * that the the user must be removed from that role.
